# Campus Chat App

### Rockstar Developers -- Team #1

### Bryson Howell, Spencer Howell, Ankush Patel, Hearan Kim

## Introduction
After three sprints of development in a Scrum framework, our team has developed a rudimentary app to allow communication between students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Due to our team having to learn the technologies behind this app, progress was slower than anticipated, and not all planned features have been fully implemented. Specifically, the geolocation feature has yet to be implemented. However, we do have an app that authenticates student accounts and allows them to communicate in a 'group chat' format.

## Customer Value
The vision for our product has not changed from the initial proposal. We are still targeting college students, starting with our campus in Knoxville with plans to expand to other campuses in the future. Our current iteration of the product does not have the geolocation feature implemented, instead requiring students to communicate in group chats focused on topics that are set up by database administrators. While we believe that this change does not drastically change the value to the customer, we still plan on implementing this feature in future iterations.

## Technology


## Team
For this iteration of our project development, our team members served in various roles. Spencer and Ankush acted as Android developers, while Hearan developed and adapted the app for iOS devices. Bryson served as our customer / tester, ensuring that the app performed properly in various scenarios.

Our team plans to continue acting in these roles for the rest of the development cycle.

## Project Management
Our schedule has changed slightly due to our team being behind our estimated schedule. The process of learning Flutter and the Dart langauge proved to take longer than anticipated, mostly due to changes made in the framework that required additional research and testing. Therefore, we are slightly behind schedule, with the implementation of the geolocation feature having to be pushed back a couple of weeks. Below is the updated schedule for the remainder of the development period:

* 4/6:  Development of geolocation feature
* 4/13: Integrate geolocation with rest of app
* 4/20: Final project testing and demo prepartion
